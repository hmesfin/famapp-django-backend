# FastAPI Backend Migration - TDD Implementation Plan

## Project Goal

Migrate family scheduler app backend from Supabase to FastAPI, removing offline-first architecture complexity. Focus on simple, online-first API with React Query for caching and optimistic updates. Deploy to Hetzner ($10/month) using existing FastAPI starter with JWT auth, Celery, SendGrid, Twilio, and Cloudflare R2.

## Technology Stack

### Backend (New Repository: `fam-api`)

- **FastAPI** - Async Python web framework
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** - Async ORM for database operations
- **Alembic** - Database migrations
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and Celery broker
- **Celery** - Background task processing
- **JWT** - Authentication (from starter)
- **SendGrid** - Transactional emails
- **Twilio** - SMS notifications
- **Cloudflare R2** - Media and static asset storage
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Pytest** - Testing framework

### Mobile App Changes (This Repository)

- **Remove**: Supabase client, offline-first data layer, sync queue, local storage
- **Add**: React Query for caching, optimistic updates, and server state management
- **Update**: All API services to use axios with FastAPI endpoints

## Migration Timeline Estimate

### Backend Development: 10-12 hours
- Phase 1: Setup & Models (2-3 hours)
- Phase 2: Schemas (1-2 hours)
- Phase 3: Authorization (1 hour)
- Phase 4-6: CRUD Endpoints (4-5 hours)
- Phase 7: Background Jobs (2 hours)

### Mobile Development: 6-8 hours
- Phase 8: Cleanup (1 hour)
- Phase 9: API Client (1 hour)
- Phase 10: API Services (2 hours)
- Phase 11: React Query Hooks (2-3 hours)
- Phase 12: Update Screens (1-2 hours)

## Notes

- **TDD Discipline**: Write tests FIRST, then implement (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **No Real-time**: Polling with React Query refetchInterval is sufficient
- **Simplicity**: Remove unnecessary complexity from offline-first architecture
- **Cost Savings**: $180/year savings ($25 Supabase â†’ $10 Hetzner)
- **Full Control**: Own the entire stack, no vendor lock-in
- **Future Features**: Celery enables background jobs (reminders, notifications, data exports)
