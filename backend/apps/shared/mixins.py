class FamilyAccessMixin:
    """
    Mixin for ViewSets handling family-scoped resources.

    Automatically filters queryset to only include resources from families
    where the request user is a member.

    Usage:
        class TodoViewSet(FamilyAccessMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            queryset = Todo.objects.all()
            ...

    Filtering Logic:
        - Includes resources where family__members contains request.user
        - Excludes resources from soft-deleted families (family.is_deleted=True)
        - Excludes soft-deleted resources (resource.is_deleted=True)
        - Preserves any additional filters on the base queryset

    Assumptions:
        - Resource model has a 'family' ForeignKey to Family
        - Resource model inherits from BaseModel (has is_deleted field)
        - Family model has 'members' ManyToManyField to User

        # Get base queryset (may have additional filters)
