# FamApp Django Backend - TDD Implementation Plan

## Project Goal

Build a family collaboration app backend using Django REST Framework with JWT authentication. Family members can create accounts, invite others, and collaborate on todos, schedules, grocery lists, and pet care. Deploy to Hetzner ($10/month) with PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, SendGrid, and Twilio.

## Technology Stack

### Backend (This Repository: `famapp-backend`)

- **Django 5.x** - Web framework (cookiecutter-django foundation)
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** - RESTful API
- **drf-simplejwt** - JWT authentication
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database (via Docker)
- **Redis** - Caching and Celery broker (via Docker)
- **Celery** - Background task processing (already configured)
- **SendGrid** - Transactional emails
- **Twilio** - SMS notifications
- **Cloudflare R2** - Media and static asset storage (future)
- **Docker** - Containerization (already configured via cookiecutter-django)
- **Pytest** - Testing framework

### Mobile App (Separate Repository)

- **React Native** - Mobile framework
- **React Query** - Server state management, caching, optimistic updates
- **axios** - HTTP client for API calls

## Notes

- **TDD Discipline**: Write tests FIRST, then implement (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Django Patterns**: Follow cookiecutter-django conventions
- **Model Inheritance**: ALWAYS use BaseModel/SimpleBaseModel from shared app
- **Import Paths**: Import from `apps.shared.models` NOT `backend.apps.shared.models`
- **Docker Workflow**: Run Django commands via `docker compose run --rm django`
- **Soft Deletes**: Use `is_deleted` flag, don't hard delete (except where appropriate)
- **UUID Exposure**: Use `public_id` in APIs, never expose internal `id`
- **Authorization**: Use DRF permissions (IsFamilyMember, IsFamilyAdmin) consistently
- **Celery**: Already configured in cookiecutter-django, just add tasks
- **Cost Savings**: $180/year savings ($25 Supabase → $10 Hetzner)
- **Full Control**: Own the entire stack, no vendor lock-in
- **Future Features**: Celery enables background jobs (reminders, notifications, exports)

## Enhancements & Future Improvements

This section documents post-MVP enhancements to improve UX, security, and mobile-first experience.

### Enhancement 1: OTP-Based Email Verification (Mobile-First) 🔐

**Current State**: Email verification uses magic links (click-to-verify URLs)
**Problem**: Poor UX on mobile apps (forces app switching, email client dependency, link expiration issues)
**Solution**: Replace with OTP (One-Time Password) verification codes

**Why OTP for Mobile Apps?**
- ✅ **Better UX**: User stays in-app, no app switching required
- ✅ **Higher conversion**: Simple 6-digit code entry (familiar pattern)
- ✅ **Security**: Time-limited codes (5-10 min), one-time use, rate limiting
- ✅ **Mobile-first**: Native numeric keyboard, paste support, auto-fill
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly, easier for users with dexterity issues

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Store OTP codes in Redis with TTL (time-to-live)
2. Generate 6-digit random codes
3. Send via email (existing SendGrid integration)
4. API endpoints for verification and resend
5. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. Optional: Hybrid approach (OTP primary, magic link fallback)

---

### TDD Plan: OTP Email Verification

**Target**: Replace magic link email verification with OTP codes for mobile-first experience

#### Phase A: OTP Model & Storage (Redis) ✅ COMPLETE

**Note**: OTP codes will be stored in Redis (not database) with automatic expiration via TTL.

- [x] **TEST**: OTP generation and storage ✅ 15 tests passing!
  - [x] Write test: Generate 6-digit OTP code (random, numeric)
  - [x] Implement: `apps/users/otp.py` - `generate_otp()` function
  - [x] Write test: OTP code length is exactly 6 digits
  - [x] Implement: Length validation in generator
  - [x] Write test: Store OTP in Redis with user email as key
  - [x] Implement: Redis cache backend integration (Django's cache framework)
  - [x] Write test: OTP expires after 10 minutes (TTL)
  - [x] Implement: Redis key expiration using cache.set(key, value, timeout=600)
  - [x] Write test: Retrieve OTP from Redis by email
  - [x] Implement: cache.get() for OTP retrieval
  - [x] Write test: OTP is deleted from Redis after retrieval (one-time use)

  - [ ] Implement: Logging in send_otp_email()

#### Phase C: OTP Verification Endpoint

- [ ] **TEST**: POST /api/auth/verify-otp/
  - [ ] Write test: Verify OTP with correct code marks user as verified
  - [ ] Implement: `apps/users/api/auth_views.py` - VerifyOTPView
  - [ ] Write test: Returns 200 with JWT tokens on success

#### Phase G: Rate Limiting & Security

- [ ] **TEST**: OTP rate limiting
  - [ ] Write test: Max 3 OTP verification attempts per 5 minutes
  - [ ] Implement: Redis-based attempt counter (key: f"otp_attempts:{email}", TTL: 300)
  - [ ] Write test: Returns 429 "Too many attempts" after limit exceeded
  - [ ] Implement: Increment counter on each attempt, check before validation
  - [ ] Write test: Counter resets after successful verification
  - [ ] Implement: cache.delete() attempts counter on success
  - [ ] Write test: Max 5 OTP resend requests per hour
  - [ ] Implement: Separate rate limit for resend endpoint
  - [ ] Write test: IP-based rate limiting (prevent bulk attacks)
  - [ ] Implement: Use django-ratelimit or custom Redis rate limiter

#### Phase H: Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] **TEST**: OTP security logging
  - [ ] Write test: Log OTP generation (email, timestamp, expiration)
  - [ ] Implement: Logging in generate_otp()
  - [ ] Write test: Log OTP verification attempts (success/failure)
  - [ ] Implement: Logging in verify-otp endpoint
  - [ ] Write test: Log rate limit violations
  - [ ] Implement: Logging in rate limiter
  - [ ] Write test: Alert on suspicious activity (10+ failed attempts)
  - [ ] Implement: Celery task for security alerts

#### Phase I: Documentation & E2E Tests

- [ ] **TEST**: OTP flow documentation
  - [ ] Write test: OpenAPI schema includes /verify-otp/ endpoint
  - [ ] Implement: drf-spectacular decorators on VerifyOTPView
  - [ ] Write test: OpenAPI schema includes /resend-otp/ endpoint
  - [ ] Implement: drf-spectacular decorators on ResendOTPView
  - [ ] Write test: E2E test - signup → receive OTP → verify → login
  - [ ] Implement: E2E test in apps/shared/tests/test_e2e_flows.py
  - [ ] Write test: E2E test - login with unverified email → resend OTP → verify → login
  - [ ] Implement: E2E test for resend flow
  - [ ] Update README: Document OTP verification flow
  - [ ] Update API docs: Add OTP endpoint examples

#### Phase J: Cleanup Old Magic Link Code (OPTIONAL)

- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Remove magic link verification
  - [ ] Remove: `send_verification_email()` function (keep as fallback?)
  - [ ] Remove: `/api/auth/verify-email?token=...` endpoint (keep as fallback?)
  - [ ] Update: User model docstrings (mention OTP verification)
  - [ ] Update: Tests that reference magic links
  - [ ] Decision: Keep magic link as fallback option? (Hybrid approach)

**Enhancement 1 Summary:**
- 🎯 **Goal**: Replace magic links with OTP codes for better mobile UX
- 📧 **Storage**: Redis with 10-minute TTL (automatic expiration)
- 🔐 **Security**: Rate limiting, one-time use, attempt counters
- 📱 **Mobile-First**: 6-digit codes, numeric keyboard, familiar pattern
- 🧪 **TDD Approach**: 50+ tests covering generation, storage, verification, rate limiting
- 🚀 **Deliverables**: 2 new endpoints (/verify-otp/, /resend-otp/), updated registration flow
- ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (with comprehensive testing)
- 🌐 **Hybrid Option**: Keep magic links as fallback (low priority users)
